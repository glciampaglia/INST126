Rhyme I: Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way
Rhyme II: Bells on bob tail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight!
Rhyme III: Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way. Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
Rhyme IV: Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way; Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
