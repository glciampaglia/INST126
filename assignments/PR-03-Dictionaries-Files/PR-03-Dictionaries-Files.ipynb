    "\n",
    "Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria (see on ELMS for more info):\n",
    "* __Correctness__: _Does the program adequately solve the problem posed for the project? (Note we use autograder to determine this.)_\n",
    "* __Logic__: _Regardless of execution, is the solution approach taken sound (i.e., likely to lead to a solution)? Note: this requirement can be satisfied even if the program isn’t passing the autograder tests!_\n",
    "* __Style__: _Is the code understandable and well documented?_\n",
    "  * _Is the variable names clear and intuitive (e.g. `rate` instead of `x`) and there are no conflicts with names of existing functions (e.g. you call your list `list_of_numbers` instead of `list`, etc.)?_\n",
    "  * _Are the key elements of the code clearly documented with comments?_\n",
    "  * _Are the main functions documented with a complete docstring?_\n",
    "* __Final Checklist__: _All steps in the \"Submission checklist\" below have been followed_.\n",

    "### Working on Multiple Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to complete all problems in the notebook: if your code passes all the tests in a single problem it will pass the autograder for the whole project. That said, you will earn credit for passing any test in the notebook. This means that if you are not passing all the tests in a given problem, you can attempt a different problem and see if you can pass any of its tests. However, keep in mind that we will consider all the problems you submit when grading for logic and style."
